    #{_ 'This project is a work in progress! I created it because there didn’t seem to be a source of time series charts showing the number of novel coronavirus cases per day *for each U.S. state*. This site provides easy access to such charts, showing the last 30 days of data (or whatever’s available if it’s less than 30 days); the data is courtesy of the wonderful [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/).'}

    #{_ 'My aim is for this site to be easy to use and accessible to all users, including visually impaired users and those without JavaScript support. If you have a feature request, or if you’d like to contribute code or otherwise collaborate, please feel free to file an issue at our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/marnen/covid_tracking_charts).'}
    
    **#{_ 'Note:'}** #{_ 'This application is temporarily nonfunctional because the [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com) is no longer providing a data feed. We thank the COVID Tracking Project for all their work and hope to find a new data feed so we can continue running this application. Please see https://github.com/marnen/covid_tracking_charts/issues/79 for updates on that.'}
